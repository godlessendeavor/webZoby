    Welcome to my web. Some features are still under development, but you can see that some contents as my resume are available. <br>I Hope you enjoy it! <br> NEW: Now this web is available to access via mobile. (Only in Spanish) Cheers!<br><br>
	 <p>This page uses:<br>
	 <ul>
	 <li>HTML: &iexcl;of course! </li>
	 <li>CSS: essential for a good display of contents. It uses Reset CSS by Eric Meyer to initialize user and browser imposed properties. Better viewed with a CSS3 compliant browser. </li>
	 <li>Javascript: a little bit, just the essential. Some of the snippets are based on Dreamweaver templates. It also uses the powerful jQuery library.</li>
	 <li>PHP: basic for doing database queries, the blog is connected via php to a MySQL database to manage the content. Languages are also managed by PHP. Apart from that I try to make all the operations on server and not on client\'s browser.</li>
	 <li>MySQL: mentioned above.</li>
	 </ul>
